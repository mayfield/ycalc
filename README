ycalc
========
"ycalc is an X-window calculator, with much more functions than the standard xcalc and is heavily influenced by TI-59." - Ulf Nordquist


About
--------
About 25 years ago Ulf wrote this fine xcalc replacement that has excellent
features like an interactive binary view of your numbers.  I found this little
calculator to be indispensable for bit hacking back in the day.

I believed to have been long gone but while cleaning out an old system before
clearing it's disk I noticed I had a 32bit i386 Linux build of ycalc that still
ran on my modern Linux system.

Inspired by the fact that this 25 year old program still ran on a modern system
I found the source code on waybackmachine and have placed it here.  I made just
a couple minor tweaks to get the build working and to use a more appropriate
font size and ycalc is back to its original glory!

Enjoy this great little calculator by Ulf Nordquist!
